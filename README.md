# Snake-Game
The base application for the work is a Javascript implementation of the traditional Snake game. THE
encoding follows the Functional Paradigm.<br>
The game consists of a "snake", controlled by the user through the keyboard, that moves without
interruption in four possible directions: North, South, East, West. There is an "apple" that appears
randomly on the screen, and by eating it, the snake grows in size.

# How to run the application
1 - Use local server like XAMPP, among others. Opening the .html file on the server.<br>
2 - Using Live Server extension in VsCode. After installing the extension in Vscode itself, the option "Go Live" will appear in the lower right corner. Clicking on the option with the game folder open in Vscode your browser will open the game normally.
